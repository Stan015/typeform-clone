# Typeform clone

This is a practice purpose project. In this project, I will clone the homepage of typeform.com with all its features/navigations and feels using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is to keep busy during free periods actually doing a thing.

I started this clone because typeform.com is one of the the complex website with lots of navigations, grid, flex and more...which I think would be a good one to learn more on working on complex websites...I am loving it as I gets to practice more on dropdowns in dropdowns, lots of navigations and more. pretty cool stuff.
